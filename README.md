# Detecting-Fraud-Transactions

A dataset containing imbalanced data is provided. The data is cleaned and necessary explorations are done on the dataset.Correaltions between the data are calculated and appro actins are taken for highly correlated data.
Data is trained and predicted using various ML models. Metrics are used to evaluate the ML models.'imbleanr' is used to balance the imbalanced dataset via oversampling and undersampling.balanced data is further trained and
predicted using the same ML models again. ML models are re evaluated. Neural Networks are implemented using the Balanced data and evaluated using the metrics.
